There are several methods that can be called within the main function. You will see that
the first line of the main calls `setup()`. `setup()` is used by the program to create some global variables
that will be used when logging into NUCareers. Inside `login.yaml` enter your username and password as well
as your chrome driver. Also included in the login should be the name of your resume in pdf format which should
be placed in the same directory as this project. Finally, enter your time period when looking for co-ops. This
should follow the pattern `Year - Season`. If none is supplied it will default to `2020 - Spring`.
