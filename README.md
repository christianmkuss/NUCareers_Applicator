# Northeastern University Careers Applicator

This is still a rough work in progress but basically you can apply to some
jobs and it will go through the jobs you have already applied to and get 
the most common words used throughout the job description. It will make a profile
from these words and then use that to apply to future jobs.

There is still a lot that needs to be done and I don't have access to NUCareers at
the moment sooo we will see.
